## Summary of our product:
Our product is a chatbot that users can interact with to easily access and utilize [Dune](https://dune.com/)â€™s sophisticated and large query system. It is not just a chatbot to access Dune, but a means for users to specify query-based "events," which, if triggered will notify the user.
example:
user specifies an "event" which triggers if bitcoin transactions exceed 100,000 per day.
