## Summary of our product:
Our product is a chatbot that users can interact with to easily access and utilize [Dune](https://dune.com/)â€™s sophisticated and large query system. It is not just a chatbot to access Dune, but a means for users to specify query-based "events," which, if triggered will notify the user.
### example:
User specifies an "event" which triggers if the number of Bitcoin transactions exceeds 100,000 within a 24 hour time period
